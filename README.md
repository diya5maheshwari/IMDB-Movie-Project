## Key Features

  * **Dynamic Homepage**: A stunning landing page with a hero section that rotates through featured movies, interactive carousels for "Trending" and "Coming Soon" categories using **Swiper.js**, and a showcase of featured actors.
  * **Comprehensive Movie Details**: Detailed pages for each movie, displaying ratings, genres, duration, a full synopsis, creator and writer information, streaming availability, and a gallery of photos.
  * **In-Depth Actor Profiles**: Dedicated pages for actors, providing detailed biographies, filmographies with links to their movies, a comprehensive list of major awards and nominations, and social media links.

  * **Centralized Data Management**: A robust "single source of truth" for all movie and actor data located in the `src/data` directory. This architecture ensures data consistency across all components and prevents mismatch errors, making the application scalable and easy to update.
  * **Interactive Review System**: A fully functional review section where users can add their own reviews for movies, vote on the relevance of existing reviews, and delete their own submissions.
  * **Responsive Design**: A fluid and modern UI built with Tailwind CSS that provides an optimal and accessible viewing experience on all devices, from mobile phones to desktop computers.
